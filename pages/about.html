    <h1>About Me</h1>
    

    <p>My name is Sonny Torres and I am an analyst and self-taught programmer who currently lives in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.</p>
<p>In 2015 I graduated from the University of North Texas with a Bachelors Degree in Finance. What attracted me to Finance was the equity market's complexity, abundance of data and the analysis required to understand the data.</p>
<p>Most people familiar with finance investing will tell you that unless you have a PhD in a hard science, can write extremely complex models in C++ AND are equiped with the various resources that come with working at a multi-billion dollar hedge fund...you will likely fail at making money in the stock market. To quote Will Ferrell in The Other Guys, &quot;You are outgunned and outmanned.&quot; The experts will tell the layman that your best chance at making a modest return in the stock market is to invest in an index fund, spend conservatively and wait 30+ years for your investments to appreciate.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, my love for complex financial data remained strong and I landed a job as an analyst at a small financial consulting company that specializes in securitized commercial real estate loans. In this role I have gained invaluable experience with manipulating large data sets and modeling commercial property cash flows.</p>
<p>After pushing the limits of excel, I decided to commit to learning how to program in December 2016 and it has been a very rewarding (and challenging!) journey.</p>
<p>My goal for this blog is to showcase what I have learned, document my future programming journey and for it to be a resource for other budding programmers who are interested in data science. Feel free to contact me.</p>
